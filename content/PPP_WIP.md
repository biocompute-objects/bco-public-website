### BioCompute PPP
The BioCompute Public Private Partnership (PPP) is comprised of several groups and individuals from regulatory, academia, and private industry that have contributed to the concept, development, testing, and/or feedback of the BioCompute project. The first formal structure to take shape is the Public Private Partnership, which focuses on the application of the IEEE standard. (Note that the PPP is not responsible for the development of the IEEE standard. The standard was developed by the P2791 Working Group, and the difference between these two is explained [here](/organization). The object of the PPP is to facilitate the efficient communication of certain critical elements of genomic analyses for the purpose of rendering genomic analyses more easily and beneficially consumed by research institutions, clinical and diagnostic care facilities, biotech and pharma entities, and regulatory bodies such as the FDA.

### Leadership

The BioCompute Public Private Partnership is the nexus of many fields with interests in the communication bioinformatic workflow analysis. Leadership for the Public Private Partnership consists of an [Executive Steering Committee](/leadership/#esc), which engages in outreach and has executive oversight over the project, and a [Technical Steering Committee](/leadership/#tsc) which builds tools and resources related to the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8699141" class=regular target="_blank">IEEE-2791-2020</a> standard, and provides technical guidance to the community.. The idea of forming a grassroots community working with the BioCompute Standard (IEEE-2791) was the brainchild of Raja Mazumder (GW)) and Vahan Simonyan(FDA).

### Mission

The mission of the Public Private Partnership is to:
 - Develop a community of stakeholders with interests in creating a versatile data harmonization framework that allows the standardized definition of platform-independent bioinformatics pipelines for execution, and is easily read by humans and machines.
 - Facilitate the development of tools and facilities implementing data typing, instantiation, deposition, storage, and distribution of validated BioCompute Objects through a BioCompute database, in order to enable reproducible scientific research and regulatory submissions of data and computations.
 - Facilitate portability of pipelines for execution.
 
### Services 
Members of the PPP are provided the following services:
- BCO Certification
- BCO Verification
- BCO Database
- BCO Technical Support
