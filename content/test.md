### <a name="BCO Portal"></a>

The [BCO Portal](https://portal.aws.biochemistry.gwu.edu/) is a form based creation tool for generating BioCompute Objects. The BCO Portal contains built-in linting and conformance against the current BioCompute specification. The BCO Portal includes a database of created BCOs. Unless specified in the embargo field, BCOs in the database are viewable to the general public.

### <a name="Platform Specific Tools"></a>

#### HIVE BCO App

The High-throughput Integrated Virtual Environment ([HIVE](https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/dna.cgi?cmd=main)) for genome analysis and the widely used, open source Galaxy project both have platform specific tools for generating BioCompute Objects from workflows. Both of these can be found on our [home page](/#tools).
