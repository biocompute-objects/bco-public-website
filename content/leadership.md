Dr. Keeney's academic experience is cross disciplinary at the intersection of neuroscience and genomics. Work with Jim Sikela at the University of Colorado investigated the functional role of copy number genomics in the evolutionary expansion of the primate brain, where he was a Coleman Institute for
Cognitive Disability Fellow, and a student at Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. He has experience in functional genomics and designing bioinformatic analyses, including novel experimental design for bioinformatic data collection. 

Dr. Keeney has also worked in the private sector as a Technical Specialist for a patent law firm in Denver, Colorado, as a startup cofounder, and as Director of Complex Visualization for a medical device company. He has been an invited author to a live discussion with Digg Dialog, and a judge for a startup pitch competition. During this time, he maintained strong connections to academia, and assisted with the establishment and development of three different public private partnerships. He brings experience in both the academic and private sectors in his current role, in which he leads multiple initiatives. Most notably, Dr. Keeney currently drives the creation of a public-private partnership around BioCompute, leads the development of the BioCompute project into a <a href="http://sites.ieee.org/sagroups-2791/">formal IEEE standard</a>, and serves as the Managing Director for the Executive Steering Committee of the BioCompute Partnership.
