## Upcoming Workshops

#### November 2020: Introduction to workflow portability with BCO-CWL [11-20-20]

**Date**: Friday November 20th at 12-2PM ET

**Purpose**: BioCompute Objects (BCOs) were developed to aid in communicating a more thorough understanding of computational analyses. While BCOs can be leveraged for re-execution within the context of specific platforms that have integrated them, they are not used for cross platform implementations. Common Workflow Language (CWL) was developed to assist in the portability of execution, meaning the ability to reproduce a pipeline in a different computational environment. The BCO and CWL teams have partnered over the last year to develop a joint mechanism that enables both portability of execution and strong human- and machine-readable documentation through metadata records. New functionality of BCO-CWL means that a reviewer may be able to independently run a computational pipeline used by a sponsor if using a command line environment, or on a platform that supports CWL. This presentation will go over the project by introducing the concept of portability of execution, the concept of a CWL file, and demonstrate the initial draft of a BCO-CWL implementation.

## Previous Workshops

## 2020

#### March 2020 BioCompute Advisory Boards Workshop

**Date**: Wednesday March 18, 2020 2-4pm ET

**Purpose**: The purpose of this workshop is to facilitate dialogue between Advisory Board(s) members on BioCompute applications, vocabulary, and current + future progression of the project through a hands-on approach. These discussions are a means to obtain feedback, introduce potential use-cases, and bring everyone up to speed about BioCompute.

#### June 2020 BioCompute Workshop for Reviewers: Tool for Communicating Sequencing Analysis

**Date**: Wednesday June 24, 2020 10am-12pm ET

**Purpose**: The purpose of this workshop is to facilitate dialogue and show BCO utility specifically for FDA reviewers. We will be briefly discussing BioCompute applications, vocabulary, current + future progression of the project in addition to a hands-on approach to reviewing a BCO for. These discussions are a means to introduce BCO as a tool for submission evaluation mechanism obtain feedback.
